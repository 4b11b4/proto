Hi Gang,

As promised, here is another circuit for you to play with. It can be used either as a voltage controlled crossfader or as an ordinary VCA. I hit upon this when finally realizing something that was in front of me all the time---the control currents though the voltage-to-current converter are symmetric yet opposite. It's an obvious idea once you see it and has probably been used before. But I was glad to stumble upon it.

Null out the DC thumps in the usual way. (Turn the audio inputs down, then apply a 0 to +5V square wave to the CV input.)

The usual legalese applies. Feel free to use this for personal applications but don't copy, or produce commercially. Anyone wanting to do a non-commercial PCB for EM users please contact me first.

Have fun!

Thomas Henry
